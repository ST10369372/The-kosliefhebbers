# The-kosliefhebbers

The kosliefhebbers App is a specialized platform designed for searching and exploring recipes. To enhance its functionality, we have integrated API keys, enabling seamless web searches and efficient data retrieval. Unlike the previous version, which had limited functionality, the updated app now allows users to access a vast array of recipes. The API offers both a free tier and a premium tier, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

In addition to recipe searches, we have implemented Firebase for real-time database management and user authentication. This ensures that user information remains secure, fostering trust and privacy. Users must register, which allows us to manage their profiles and communicate updates or resolve issues via email.

A notable feature is the ability for users to add their own recipes or import recipes from the API, which are then stored securely in Firebase. This allows for easy access and personalized recipe management. Moreover, we have enabled profile customization, allowing users to update personal information, reset passwords, and upload profile pictures.

Additionally, we have introduced experimental features such as notification settings, which alert users about updates or changes, and theme customization, currently limited to light and dark modes. There is also a translator feature, albeit still in development.

Finally, the app allows users to easily copy and save recipes, creating a personalized repository of culinary delights. All these enhancements ensure a seamless, user-friendly experience.
